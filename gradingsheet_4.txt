Comments:
    Good job.  The design is clean and tight.  Could
    use a little more polish with the file open, save and
    save as interaction.

    Please add authorship comments to the top of each file.
    Otherwise your comments are OK.  They could probably
    be a little more detailed.

    Clean build.

    Your main window class is getting kind of busy.  You may
    want to consider moving the shape creating stuff into
    another class.

    As we talked about in class you probably, storing the
    list as a pointer in your reader and writer class requires that
    the pointer be checked whenever it is used.  It's better
    to store it as a reference.

    The Docks menu item isn't needed because you can always access them
    by clicking on the menu bar with the right mouse button.  You just need
    to give the docks a name in the designer.

    Something appears to be broken with the file open.  It is only reading in
    one shape.  At least that is what is printed out to the output window.

    Corrupt and invalid files detected correctly.

    The shape creation detected was able to detect an invalid input.  However
    it did accept a -1 for some parameters that it shouldn't, box height -1.

    Nice addition for unique ids.

    The application should ask the user if they want to save their work before
    exiting.

    If no file has been opened or saved then the save action should work just
    like the save as action.  It appears that the save action tries to save
    a file with no file name.
